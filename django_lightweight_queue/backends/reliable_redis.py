    """
    This backend manages a per-queue-per-worker 'processing' queue. E.g. if we
    had a queue called 'django_lightweight_queue:things', and two workers, we
    would have:
      'django_lightweight_queue:things:processing:1'
      'django_lightweight_queue:things:processing:2'

    We enqueue tasks to the main queue via LPUSH, and workers grab jobs by
    atomically popping jobs from the tail of the main queue into their
    processing queue (via BRPOPLPUSH).

    On startup we remove all jobs from any processing queues, and move to the
    tail of the main queue, i.e. so they're processed next -- see `startup`
    below.  This is to stop losing jobs if the number of workers is lowered
    (e.g. if we had 2 workers, both are processing a job, we kill the queues
    and lower the number of workers to 1, without doing this tidy up we would
    never process the job stuck in worker 2s processing queue.)

    This backend has at-least-once semantics.
